# Bit-coin-transaction-clustering
  Here I use Bitcoin dataset for kaggle, then make transactions graphs. This graph is now an input to a neural network which clusters the set of closely related traders.  
1) All the code and instructions are compiled and put into the nodebook , with the name Bitcoin_user_cluster.ipynb
2) The data I scraped can be downloaded using this link.

3) Once downloaded set the "data_save_path" variable in the notebook to the csv file's location.
